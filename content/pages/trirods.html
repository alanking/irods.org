                TRiRODS is local meetup for users of iRODS software in the RDU area. TRiRODS works to build a strong sense of community, to offer a space for collaboration and sharing of individual implementations of iRODS, and to further the work on a hardened version of the code.<br><br>Quarterly meetups are planned for 2017. If you are interested in sharing your work at any of the sessions listed below, please email info@irods.org.

                    <i>By Stephen Worth, DELLEMC</i>
                    <br><br>
                    Groups maintaining data repositories at the petabyte-scale are discovering that cataloguing associated metadata is necessary to properly access, recall and analyze data.  To be successful they depend on researchers and data curators to design and provide the user defined metadata to be successful. Metalnx was developed to aid researchers with metadata management under iRODS (the Integrated Rule Oriented Data System) and is now an open source project (<a href="https://metalnx.github.io/" >metalnx.github.io</a> or <a href="http://www.github.com/metalnx">www.github.com/metalnx</a>)
                    <br><br>
                    This talk explains the motivation for this work, demonstrates the operational behavior of Metalnx, provides a preview of our work in data validation, and looks at a model for applying adaptive, hierarchical metadata to research curation.

                    <h3>Metadata Templates in iRODS</h3>
                    <i>By Rick Skarbez, iRODS Consortium</i>
                    <br><br>
                    Metadata templates represent a significant addition of functionality to iRODS’s handling of metadata. In base iRODS, metadata is stored in the catalog as unadorned attribute-value-unit (AVU) triples of strings. This is flexible for many use cases, but does not afford the grid administrators much control of any stored metadata. By extending iRODS metadata, specifically by associating the AVU triples stored in the catalog with metadata templates which can provide additional information about these metadata elements (or meta-metadata), we can now support a variety of interesting functions.
                    <br><br>
                    This talk will explain the motivation behind metadata templates, present a proof of concept implementation of metadata templates, and demonstrate the use of this implementation via their REST API, currently in development.
