Author: Terrell Russell
Slug: irods-development-update-november-2020
Status: published


This month is apparently already half over and the Holidays are coming soon.

We're still focusing our efforts to get 4.2.9 out the door.  

We're building more docker-based testing into CI for clients, testing the S3 plugin against various member appliances, filling out more Admin GUI functionality, bettering our CMake build and packaging, experimenting with RDMA, and writing policy for our partners.

TRiRODS in December is still an open slot.  Let us know if you're interested in sharing some work in progress.

        - working with KTH cluster and RENCI Hatteras cluster
    - Jenkins Testing Client Job Template
        - based on docker-compose

        - template for other iRODS clients
    - Build and Packaging
        - building with Clang10

- Active Development Work

    - Rule Execution Info (for delay rules) migrated to the catalog
        - the server no longer creates REI files
        - REI information is stored in the catalog as JSON
        - JSON REI stored in a new database column called r_rule_exec.exe_context
        - new column is TEXT/CLOB
        - uses server_config.advanced_settings.run_delay_server = True/False
        - documented assumption of one per zone
        - no migration tool - no downtime - just processes any existing REI files
        - delay rules that use session variables will not be migrated
            - will continue to be executed as long as the REI file exists
        - [RFC at GitHub](https://github.com/irods/irods_rfcs/blob/master/0006_static_peps_and_delay_rules.md)
