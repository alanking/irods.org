We did not hold the Technology Working Group in November since it would have occurred at the same time we were in Denver at [SC17](https://sc17.supercomputing.org/).  We had a tremendous show and held over 20 meetings in our booth over the course of three days.  In addition, I spoke about ["Data Management Design Patterns"](http://slides.com/irods/sc17-data-management-design-patterns#/) in the DDN booth, the HGST booth (3x), and in the Purdue University booth.  Video of that talk should be online soon.

I will be posting about the three demos we shared at [our SC17 workshop]({filename}/pages/sc17.html) over the next week.

Most notably during the preparation for those demos, [we released the Audit (AMQP) Rule Engine Plugin]({filename}/posts/initial-irods-audit-amqp-rule-engine-plugin-is-released.md).

We have a lot of follow-up to do (it was exhausting, but validating).  The month of December should give us a chance to reflect, focus on our plans for 2018, and start off strong again.

Demand for what we provide is up, we're moving faster than ever before, and *we're hiring*.

If you know modern C++, want to help science, and want to work in Chapel Hill, NC -- please get in touch.
