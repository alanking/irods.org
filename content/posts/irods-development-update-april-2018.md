Slug: irods-development-update-april-2018
Status: published


The proofs-of-concept have come together.  The plugins are green in CI.  A release is imminent.

This month has been a lot of tying up loose ends as we prepare for the [iRODS User Group Meeting in Durham, NC (June 5-7, 2018)]({filename}/pages/ugm2018.html).

We're going to announce the agenda within the next week and begin preparing our own presentations and demos.  There is a lot to share and to show.



### April Technology Working Group

- [4.1.12](https://github.com/irods/irods/milestone/27)

    We are so very close now.  If we get the logging done well, we are aiming for this to be the last 4.1.x release.

- [4.2.3](https://github.com/irods/irods/milestone/28)

    The last of the plugins are coming online now - we'll release as soon as possible.  Outstanding issues will be moved to a 4.2.4 milestone.

- [4.3.0](https://github.com/irods/irods/milestone/16)

    Not as much focus here at this time.  We port all bugfixes back and all features forward.  So the work above is going into the master branch as well.

- Fourth Metalnx Working Group

    Hosted on April 16.  The domains have been transfered to the iRODS Consortium, website updates soon.  The branches are merged, and a v2.0.0 release will occur before the iRODS User Group Meeting in June.
