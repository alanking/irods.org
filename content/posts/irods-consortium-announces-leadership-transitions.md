The Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) - the founding member that administers the iRODS Consortium - announced today that Jason Coposky has officially resigned from his post as iRODS Consortium Executive Director effective June 11, 2021.

Coposky has been at RENCI for fifteen years and has served as the Executive Director of the Consortium for the last five and a half years and as Chief Technologist for five years before that. In these leadership roles, Coposky managed the software development team, directed the full software development lifecycle, and coordinated code hardening, testing, and application of formal software engineering practices. He also built and nurtured relationships with existing and potential consortium members and served as the chief spokesperson on iRODS development and strategies to the worldwide iRODS community. The Consortium has more than tripled in size under his leadership.  

In addition to growing the community, Coposky has been instrumental in turning the open source iRODS platform into enterprise software that is now deployed as a data management and data sharing solution at businesses, research centers, and government agencies in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. 

Terrell Russell, who has also been working on iRODS software since the development team transitioned to RENCI in 2008 and has held the role of Chief Technologist for the past five and a half years, has been named Interim Executive Director.
