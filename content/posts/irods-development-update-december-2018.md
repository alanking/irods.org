Title: iRODS Development Update: December 2018
Date: 2018-12-30 13:00
Author: Terrell Russell
Slug: irods-development-update-december-2018
Status: published

Not as much to report this December - everything slows down quite a bit in University land over the holiday break.

Work on the Automated Ingest Framework has proceeded, mostly focused on hardening and testing coverage.

The cacheless and detached storage resource effort is very close to a working implementation for all plugin operations when talking to S3 (through Minio for testing).

And in some experimental work, iRODS can now be installed, configured, and started up while using UUIDs as primary identifiers within the catalog rather than sequences.  This is exciting as we continue to target a future consisting of all iRODS servers in the role of catalog provider (via CockroachDB).

2018 has flown by and we are very happy with our progress.  With 4-1-stable now EOL, all eyes are focused on 2019, increased adoption, and continued community development of higher-order solutions built on top of iRODS.

Happy New Year everyone!

        - weekly, compressed, 26x
    - consider means to point different 'types' to separate log files/locations
    - [RFC](https://github.com/irods/irods_rfcs/blob/master/0001_logging.md)

- Cacheless and Detached Storage Resources

    - remove the need for a compound resource and cache management
    - first work on S3
    - plan to do the same with HPSS, unixfilesystem, WOS, UnivMSS 
    - HOST_MODE=['archive_attached', 'cacheless_attached', 'cacheless_detached']
    - fetching credentials from somewhere elseâ€¦ TBD
    - can my users BYOB(bucket/identity/credentials)?  Only accessible to particular set of users.
    - How would bad authentication to S3 get back to the user?
    - [#1849](https://github.com/irods/irods_resource_plugin_s3/issues/1849)

- Metadata RFC

    - irods::storage_tiering::<property>
    - filesystem::<property>
    - want to document the usage patterns
    - any other conventions that we should consider?
    - [RFC](https://github.com/irods/irods_rfcs/blob/master/0004_standard_metadata_attributes.md)
